# Do not delete email after responding

Outlook usually sends meeting requests to the Deleted Items folder when you respond to a meeting request. To change this setting and keep your meeting requests:

1. Click the `File` tab, then `Options`, and then select `Mail.
2. Under the `Send messages` heading, make sure the `Delete meeting requests and notifications from Inbox after responding` checkbox is not selected.
3. Click the `OK` button to close the dialog box.

# Change the default font, color, style, and size for messages in classic Outlook

1. On the `File` tab, choose `Options` > `Mail`.
2. Under `Compose messages`, choose `Stationery and Fonts`.
3. On the `Personal Stationery` tab, under `New mail messages` or `Replying or forwarding messages`, choose `Font`.
4. In the `Font` box, choose the font, style, size, and color that you want to use. You can see a preview of your changes as you make them.
5. Choose `OK` three times to return to Outlook.

Your new settings will take effect immediately.
