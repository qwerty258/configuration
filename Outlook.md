Outlook
=======

Outlook usually sends meeting requests to the Deleted Items folder when you respond to a meeting request. To change this setting and keep your meeting requests:

1. Click the **File** tab, then **Options**, and then select **Mail**.
2. Under the **Send messages** heading, make sure the **Delete meeting requests and notifications from Inbox after responding** checkbox is not selected.
3. Click the **OK** button to close the dialog box.
